		<h1>Basic Information</h1>
			<p>I am currently a freshman Boston University. I plan on pursuing Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer science. I am a Trustee Scholar at the university. I am also a student at Kilachand Honors College, where I am taking courses in the social sciences and humanities.</p>
		<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>I can code in Python and Ruby. I am also in the process of learning HTML and CSS, with this website being one of my projects. As of now, all my knowledge in computer science is self-taught. I learnt all of this over the summer after my highschool graduation. I am an extremely committed and a fast learner; I give my 100% to any task I am handed.</p>
