   <span class="heading">Write a formal, academic essay in which you imagine that you are in a position of leadership in your country or your local community (note that while many leaders who effect change are politicians, they can also be scholars, activists, scientists, artists, etc.). Choose an issue about which you, as this leader, feel passionately and describe it in detail, giving your informed reader a sense of the arguments and counterarguments associated with the issue. Tell us where you stand and why, using description and analysis of real-world evidence as well as your unique perspective as an influential member of your community. Hypothetically, how would you address this issue and what would your community or country look like as a result of your actions?

The issue of tackling climate change has been a cause for widespread concern for quite some time. Global warming may still be a hoax to many disbelievers, but the available empirical data can no longer be brushed under the carpet. The signs of global warming are unmistakable. The average temperature of the earth has increased by 1oF; sea levels have risen by 4-8 inches, and the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland are melting at an unprecedented rate of 500 km3 per year . One of the immediate threats is the submerging of small islands, most of which have done little to contribute to it. We are already seeing that the Great Barrier Reef is likely to be wiped out as a result of climate change , and so will other biodiversity that cannot adapt fast enough. The issue of pollution in Chinese cities proves the dangers of unbridled industrialization. The air quality of major Indian cities is also amongst the worst in the world. If we continue down this path, our future generations will suffer the consequences. Yet, there is a surprising lack of consensus among nations on the roadmap to reverse this trend. 
Recent events at the UN Climate Change Summit in New York in August 2014 only reinforce this disagreement. The lack of progress in charting an implementable roadmap is symptomatic of the rich versus poor divide. Developing nations believe that this problem is largely the creation of the industrialized world, and therefore, they should primarily be responsible for funding the solutions. The developed countries, on the other hand, expect the large emerging economies like China and India, among the largest emitters of CO2, to also contribute to the effort. However, these countries believe that the attendant cost of green technologies would stand in the way of rapid economic development, which they see as their inalienable right. Similarly, even wealthy nations are resisting firm targets for CO2 reduction in the belief that it would make their economies less competitive.
Everyone worries about the cost of these technologies and the consequent loss of economic competitiveness it would bring. But in my view, this is a myopic approach. After all, the future of this world cannot be sacrificed at the altar of profit. There is a beacon of hope in countries like Germany and Denmark, who are showing the way. In these countries, renewables contribute 30-40% of energy needs. They have taken initiative to be responsible citizens of this world. This is what I aim to do as well.
In India, the awareness about the need for more renewable energy is finally gaining momentum. If I were a political leader, I would capitalize on this. To begin with, I would make pollution data of all our large cities available to the public, as it would be the biggest motivator to improve things. Most of India’s carbon comes from electricity generation and road transportation. With only 12.5% of power generated through renewable resources , the potential is huge. The country receives an average of 5000TkWh of solar insolation annually ; therefore, solar energy can form the backbone of our energy grid. Off-grid solar power and utilization of roof tops of buildings to set up micro solar plants would reduce dependence on conventional power sources. Wind and tidal energy should also be promoted, since it is always good to diversify, even in renewables. To make such energy affordable for individual households, government subsidy would be required. This would be possible if we tax businesses that contribute to the increase in CO2, and utilize the money to subsidize eco-friendly ventures. Though initial cost of such technologies is high, recurring expenditures are comparatively low; therefore, they would give promising returns over the long term.
The developed world should lead the way, as they not only have the resources but are often the repositories of these green technologies. If we push for renewables, in the long run, it would provide cheaper power to the millions of poor people in the developing world. Better power availability will increase economic activity thereby reducing poverty. It will also help provide better access to health services and education, especially in rural areas. A better educated and aware public would further the cause of sustainable development. This dream can be a reality if we have the passion to change things, and I firmly believe in what Gandhi has said: "Be the change you wish to see in this world."
