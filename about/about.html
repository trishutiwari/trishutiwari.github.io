<p>I am a dynamic, hardworking and inquisitive person, and my achievements only reinforce my proficiency. Academic distinction is the underpinning of my success; I have always been in the top 1% in my class. I graduated as the valedictorian of the American School of Paris, and secured 41/42 subject points in the IB. Further, I have maintained a cumulative GPA of 4.0 during my time at Boston University, managing the Kilachand honors program with a challenging engineering curriculum. 
	Academic inclination is but a single facet of my multi-dimensional personality. I have also excelled in numerous extra-curricular activities, ranging from debate and art, to programming. Equipped with strong oratory skills, I twice won 2nd position in city level debate competitions amongst hundreds of participants. My interest in ecology and debating abilities provided me a chance to engage, through panel discussions, with Jane Goodall and Michael Pollan. I also possess strong written communication skills, having written many well regarded <a href="projects.html">essays and critiques</a>. As a student, I also excelled in painting and won numerous positions in various competitions. Furthermore, my exuberance is reflected in my effort to self-learn web development, Android development, Python, Ruby and SQL, all in a span of less than 5 months. My firm belief in giving back to the community has prompted me to work with Freedom House--a non-profit organization--to build an app for college applicants.
I believe these qualities prompted Boston University to select me as a Trustee Scholar, a merit scholarship awarded to around 20 students from thousands of applicants. And I strongly believe that these attributes will also allow me to succeed at my career.
